# Fifth generation

`freestyler` is 5th generation React styling library - it injects CSS into `<style>` tags at runtime, only when
your React component is being rendered for the first time and styles dynamically depend not only on `props`, `state`, and `context`,
but also the CSS template itself can be changed dynamically.
