# 4<sup>th</sup> Generation Interfaces

4<sup>th</sup> generation interfaces are more dynamic than [3<sup>rd</sup> generation interfaces](./3rd-gen.md),
they are either defined in component's scope or through a template that is "attached" to a component, as such they
get access to component's *props*.

> 4<sup>th</sup> gen CSS interface can use component's scope variables, such as *props* and *state*.

`freestyler` provides these 4<sup>th</sup> generation interfaces:

- [`styled()` components](./styled.md)
- [`@css` class decorator](./css-class-decorator.md)
- [`@css` render method decorator](./4th-gen-css-render-method-decorator.md)
- [`hoc()` generator](./hoc-generator.md)
- [`Component`](./Component.md)
- [`hyperstyle`](./hyperstyle.md)
